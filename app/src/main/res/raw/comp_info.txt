Problem
{
Experimental Problem,The problem that you experiment is trying to solve and / or find the answer too.
Independent Variable,The independent variable is the factor that is changed by the experimentor during the experiment.
Dependent Variable,The dependent variable is the factor that changes because of the independent variable.<br><br>The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is what you are testing for in your experiment.
}
Hypothesis
{
Variable Relationship,What is the basic relationship between the independent and dependent variables?  Are they related to one and other?
Quantitative Relationship,What is the mathematical relationship between the two variables? <br><br><b>Correlations: </b> When the relationship can be modelled by a straight line <br><br><b>Regressions: </b> When the relationship can be modelled by a more complex function<br><br><a href = "http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/BS/BS704_Multivariable/BS704_Multivariable5.html">Learn about it here</a>
Qualitative Causality,What are some qualitative (something that cannot be measured in numbers) relationships between the two variables?
}
Materials
{
Item,What materials did you use for your experiment?  Be sure to describe them exactly as well as for what you used it for in your investigation.
}
Experiment
{
Trials,These are the number of times you will repeat your experiment.  As a good rule of thumb, you should have at least three trials.
Procedure,These are the steps you will follow when performing your experiment, like a laundry list of things you need to do.
Measurement,These are the records you will keep of the changes in your variables.
